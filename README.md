The gender pay gap is the difference between average pay for men and average pay for women in a certain country or business environment. An ‘averaging’ method is usually used. This is the most popular way to measure the gender pay gap, because it allows for the comparison of all employees, regardless of whether they work full-time or part-time, or in different businesses, or are employees of different types of employers. The ‘averaging’ method is a more comprehensive way of measuring the gender pay gap, because it takes into account the earnings of different types of employees, and includes the earnings of part-time workers.
Data will be collected from a random company that has the variables Age, Gender, Qualification, Experience, Income, and Attrition will be used for this research. Since these fields are important for a company, I am expecting that the data will be accurate with no missing fields. These variables allow comparing the salaries and finding the significant relationship among the variables.
